I am hiring predoctoral fellows to work with me. If you are interested in agriculture or governance issues, please see this [call for applications](https://www.isb.edu/en/careers/academic-openings/ra-with-prof-shilpa-aggarwal---aaditya-dar.html) for researcher associates specializing in [quantitative](https://twitter.com/AadityaDar/status/1385921667529064452?s=20) methods. If you are an undergrad student looking for an internship, at this time, I donâ€™t have an opening. However, I am always looking to hear from young scholars whose interests overlap with mine. Please do not send me emails or call me about internships and instead apply [via this form](https://forms.gle/e9XCbsrzf7Fp3A5DA).
