Laxmi Iyer, Tarun Khanna and Ashutosh Varshney in a <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-028.pdf">new working paper</a> analyze the trends in caste ownership of private, non-farm, enterprises in India. They find that SCs and STs continue to be under-representated and the share of private enterprises owned by them has hardly changed between 1990 and 2005.
