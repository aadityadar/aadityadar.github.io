<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2006, NCERT developed a manual to provide an overview of the various educational indicators that are used in the country. The manual is superb and makes for a great read, if you are lucky enough to find it. When you try to access the manual (through the regular way via their website <a href="http://www.ncert.nic.in/programmes/education_survey/index_education.html" target="_blank">here</a>) you will only be able to view the cover page and content. [This is actually still nice of NCERT's web/technical team - at least it wasn't a broken link!].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But - this is exactly why we have The Open Data. [You can download the complete report from <a href="http://goo.gl/7d90v" target="_blank">here</a>]. The manual is divided into four main chapters: (1) introduction (2) how educational data is collected and analysed (3) concepts and definitions of frequently used terms (4) the main indicators and how they are calculated. Like I said, the report is great and there are two annexures that researchers may find particularly useful. One is a neat summary of the various sources of data and the other is a state-wise classification of the different education patterns (I remember always getting mixed up between which states classify primary schooling as class I-IV and which refer to it as class I-V. Table 2 clears up the confusion)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: justify;">Are you wondering how I found a work around and downloaded the report? </span><em style="text-align: justify;">Juggad</em><span style="text-align: justify;">. I googled the name of each chapter along with the name of the report and NCERT, then downloaded the individual chapters and merged all the PDFs into one file! This is a handy trick pretty useful when dealing with </span><em style="text-align: justify;">sarkari</em><span style="text-align: justify;"> websites.</span></p>
