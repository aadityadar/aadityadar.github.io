<p style="text-align: justify;">The results from the houselisting exercise that was conducted as part of the 2011 census have been <a href="http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/hlo/Houselisting_Housing_2011.html">online</a> for a while now. Most of us know that India's population is over a billion (1.2 billion to be precise) but some lesser known facts are that the population lives in 244.6 million houses,Â spread across 0.6 million villages and 7933 towns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The listing exercise also has collects data on possession of some household assets for communication and transportation. The top 3 modes of communication were: mobile/telephone (63%), television (47%) and radio/transistor (20%), while the top 3 modes of transportation are: bicycle (45%), scooter/moped/motorcycle (21%) and car/jeep/van (5%).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the most interesting data point was that 18% of the households do not possess any of the assets i.e. no mobile/telephone, no TV, no radio, no computer, no bicycle nor any vehicle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following spreadsheet summarizes the distribution of various household assets:</p>
