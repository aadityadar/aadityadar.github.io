<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have ever tried to research online, you would have come across many stumbling blocks. Isn't it bizarre how government reports just magically disappear from their websites, data which could be presented in an excel format is in a PDF form, and let's not even talk about protected/locked PDFs and broken links! The Open Data grew out of this frustration and the idea, essentially, is to present data (in all its multiple forms: reports, papers etc.) in an accessible format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The website was launched in January 2012 and we plan to update it at least once every month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we would love to hear from you. Any comments to improve this website will specially be appreciated. To contact us, please write to: admin [at] theopendata [dot] com</p>
