<p style="text-align: justify;">How closely were the UP 2012 assembly elections contested? Every one in seven assembly constituencies were won with a margin of less than 1% of the votes. The median margin of votes in this election was 6%. [Does someone have any idea of trends on this? What is the typical margin of victory in UP elections?]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: Margin of votes has been calculated as the ratio of the difference in votes between the winner and the runner up to the total number of votes cast in the assembly constituency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one considers a simplified electoral contest in all the ACs, reduces them to face-offs between 2 parties (only winner and runner up) and analyzes the data for the Samajwadi Party, one finds that SP and the BSP fought head-to-head in half of the assembly constituencies, with SP winning majority of the time (SP's strike rate against the BSP was 79% with a 8% margin of victory); BSP won only 43 out of 204 ACs against the SP with a 4% margin. When facing off against the BJP, SP's strike rate was lower at 65%, but the median margin of victory was higher at 10%. On the other hand, against the Congress, SP had a lower strike rate (58%) and a lower margin of victory (4%).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The state-level data used for analysis was collected from the ECI website using Needlebase, whereas the constituency-level data was scrapped by <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/profiles/pallih/" target="_blank">Páll Hilmarsson</a> at <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/" target="_blank">Scraperwiki</a> (Special thanks to Páll for writing the code and 'freeing the data' for 6819 candidates).</p>
