<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, I wanted to refer to one of the reports of the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector (NCEUS) and guess what - <a href="http://nceus.gov.in/">their website</a> is not available anymore. I understand that the commission was disolved couple of years ago, but why did they have to take down the website? Sigh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NCEUS came up with some really good work on the informal economy. I am uploading a few (report 3, 10 and working paper 2) that I happen to have. If you have any of the other reports or working papers, please upload them to google docs and send the link to: admin &lt;at&gt; theopendata &lt;dot&gt; com (Thanks!).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Were there any other reports or working paper that I have missed? I vaguely recall a publication on the draft national street vendor policy, but I am not sure if it was by NCEUS. Any help will be appreciated :)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Update (17 Oct 2012): Rahul Nayyar discovered many of the NCEUS reports online. They are on the DCMSME website. [<a title="DCMSME" href="http://dcmsme.gov.in/NCEUS.html" target="_blank">link</a>]</p>
