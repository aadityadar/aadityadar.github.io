<p style="text-align: justify;">You would think that it is easy to recreate a panel of Indian districts. Sigh, no. There are various complications that arise due to creation of new districts, boundary changes etc. For a neat summary, see Kumar and Somanathan's 2009 paper in Economic and Political Weekly. (A ungated version of the working paper can be found <a title="Kumar, H. and Somanathan, R. (2009)" href="http://www.cdedse.org/pdf/work176.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The details are gory, but the tables in the working paper do an excellent job of summarizing the changes.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will post the list of districts once I have compiled them all. In the meanwhile, I can share a table that provides the count of districts in each state/union territory in India since 1991, acc. to the census.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note: if you look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_India" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, you will find some discrepancies. For instance, Uttar Pradesh is said to have 75 districts, instead of 70 as recorded by the Census. I am sticking with the latter, but the odd thing is that Wikipedia actually has a link to the UP government website that actually lists all 75 districts. Funny, but true!</p>
