<p style="text-align: justify;">So, Arnab Goswami's interview of Rahul Gandhi concluded a while ago and now that the transcript is <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/report/full-transcript-of-rahul-interview-im-against-the-concept-of-dynasty/20140127.htm">online</a>, it's time to do some text analysis (I will leave the meta analysis to political commentators/analysts):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Total word count: 12720
Rahul's word count: 7595 (60%)
Arnab's word count: 5125 (40%)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">PS: In case you are wondering, Rahul Gandhi referred to himself in third person 7 times; he didn't refer to his opponents by their names (Akhilesh or Arvind Kejriwal had 0 references, but Modi had 3); and oh, the word empower or a version of it like empowering/empowered/empowerment had 23 occurrences.</p>
